# brooklyn-house-prices

This project aims to understand if there was a change of housing prices for single-family residences and single-unit apartments or condos in Brooklyn between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020. 

The 2016-2020 brooklyn csv contain the data used for this project. The data was provided by the City of New York and it contains real estate purchases within the borough of Brooklyn from 2016-2020.

The linearreg_brooklyn.R file contains code for importing and preparing the data for analysis, EDA and feature engineering, running the linear regression.

The memo_brooklyn.pdf is my analysis on the regression. This was written assuming I was working on behalf of a New York realtors association and had been asked to determine how Brooklyn home purchase prices changed between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020.
